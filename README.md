## ChatGPT

	I want to build an AI/ML tool that:
	
	1. Can read a PDF with companyâ€™s annual report
	2. Can analyse the PDF and extract values for Scope 1, 2 and 3 of Carbon Emissions
	3. Display the values in a table
	
	Describe how to build this tool, step by step.

Building an AI/ML tool for extracting and displaying carbon emissions data from a company's annual report involves several stages. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you develop such a tool:

Gather data:
Collect a large dataset of annual reports in PDF format. Ideally, these reports should come from diverse industries and contain information about Scope 1, 2, and 3 carbon emissions.

Preprocess the data:
Convert the PDFs into machine-readable text. You can use libraries like PyPDF2, pdfrw, or pdfminer.six for this task. Perform additional preprocessing like removing special characters, stop words, and other noise.

Label the data:
Manually annotate a subset of the dataset with relevant labels for Scope 1, 2, and 3 carbon emissions. This labeled data will be used for training and validation purposes.

Train a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model:
Using the labeled data, train a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model to identify and extract Scope 1, 2, and 3 carbon emissions information. You can use pre-trained models like BERT, RoBERTa, or other transformer-based models available in the Hugging Face library. Fine-tune the model on your labeled data.

Develop a table extraction algorithm:
Design an algorithm to process the extracted text and identify relevant tables containing carbon emissions data. You can use heuristic approaches, regex patterns, or machine learning techniques like deep learning-based table detection.

Post-processing and data validation:
After extracting the relevant tables, perform post-processing to clean and validate the extracted data, ensuring accuracy and consistency.

Build the user interface:
Create a user-friendly interface where users can upload a PDF file and view the extracted carbon emissions data in a table format. You can use web development frameworks like Flask or Django for the backend and React, Angular, or Vue.js for the frontend.

Integrate the components:
Connect the NER model, table extraction algorithm, and user interface, ensuring seamless integration and functionality.

Test the tool:
Perform thorough testing of the tool to identify and fix any issues or inaccuracies. This should include testing with a variety of annual reports from different industries and sources.

Deploy and monitor:
Deploy the tool on a server or cloud platform, and monitor its performance. Make sure to regularly update and maintain the tool, fine-tuning the NER model and improving the table extraction algorithm as needed.
